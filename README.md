# VE216 Signals & Systems - Recitation Class
Recitation class lecture notes for VE216.

Created and used by Teaching Assistant ZHU Yilun in Summer 2020.

# Details
VE216 is a sophomore-level course for ECE major in UM-SJTU Joint Institute. It is an introductory (and important) course for signal processing.

This repository contains 10 RC slides:

- RC 3 & 4: Purely ``handwritten'' notes using **Bamboo Paper** app in Microsoft Surface Pro. (I choose to have them handwritten because there are quite a few mathematical derivation involved.)
- Others: generated from Latex (all the source files should be contained, feel free to contact if something went wrong); I made annotations on the Latex-generated slides, saved as xxx_withNotes.pdf

The content for RC follows from the lecture given by **Prof. Yong Long**. Some exercises were selected from homework and quizzes. Some screenshots were taken from **Prof. Alan V. Oppenheim's** (well-known) lecture slides.

It is possible that some other professors in JI use different materials for this course (e.g., starting with discrete signals).

# Notice for Other Users
I graduated from SJTU in Summer 2020. I am glad to release my RC notes for future TAs (who are preparing for RCs) and students (who are looking for course-related materials).

If you were to use/modify/redistribute my slides, please give credit, by adding "Based on RC Notes by ZHU Yilun" in the first page of the slides. (It would be better if you let me know, e.g., via email.)

I would be more than delighted to hear from anyone who finds the slides useful. Feel free to send an email to **allanyilun[at]outlook[dot]com**, tell me about how you gonna use the slides, places where I made typos and how I could improve.
